# Mytchel's Trackball

A trackball 

![trackball](first-build.jpg?raw=true)

Parts:
- a 52.5mm snooker ball
- Three [8mm bearing ball rollers](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Miniature-8mm-robot-bearing-steel-ball-roller-KSM-8-Swivel-Round-Mini-Ball-Caster-Press-Mount/32838128238.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.3da24c4dzBRU55)
- ADNS 9800 laser mouse sensor.
- Adafruit ItsyBitsy 32u4 3V
- Some capacitors and transistors for the board.
- Four Cherry MX keyboard switches as buttons.
- A 3D printed cradle 
- And the PCB.

The schematics for the PCB are under (board/)[board/] and were created in GEDA.
The cradle was designed using OpenSCAD and is at (cradle/mouse.scad)[cradle/mouse.scad].
I think (cradle/mouse3.stl)[cradle/mouse3.stl] is the file I had printed.
And the code is under (src)[src] and is based off the 
[mouse example for the Teensy](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/usb_mouse.html).

Under (case/)[case] is the beginnings of the design for a case, though I think
the PCB needs some changes before this progresses much. Currently the case is
a piece of 3mm acrylic with cutouts for the switches, then heated and bent into
shape. In future I will move away from the keyboard keys to micro switches. Keys
are not meant to be used like buttons on a mouse and pretending they are will
cause pain. It does for me at least.
